||| Problem: Given an input qubit |q> and a single-qubit unitary operation U,
|||          return the state U|q>. The "Repeat Until Success" approach solves
|||          this problem in the following way:
|||
||| 1. Prepare a new qubit in state |0>
||| 2. Apply some two-qubit unitary operation U' (depends on U)
||| 3. Measure the auxiliary qubit
||| 4. With (high) probability the result is now U|q> and then stop.
||| 5. With (low) probability the result is state E|q>, where E is some other unitary operator
|||    (depending on U), so we uncompute the error by applying E^dagger and we go back to step 1.

||| 'Graph n' is the type of undirected graphs with no parallel edges and no self-loops with 'n' vertices.
||| Vertex '0' corresponds to the innermost AddVertex call in the graph expression.
||| Vertex '1' corresponds to the penultimate AddVertex call in the graph expression.
||| ...
||| Vertex 'n-1' corresponds to the outermost AddVertex call in the graph expression.
||| The second argument of AddVertex is a Vect of Bools, where the 'i'-th entry indicates whether
|||   the current vertex should be connected to the 'i'-th vertex of the graph.

||| A convenient representation of a graph cut.
||| The 'i'-th entry indicates the color of the 'i'-th vertex in the cut.

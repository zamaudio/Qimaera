-- Example of code where quantum and classical information interact
-- The VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver) algorithm finds the lowest eigenvalue for an Hamiltonian operator
-- More precisely, we suppose that the eigenstate corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue is given by some ansatz
-- that depends on some parameters, and we optimize the value of the parameters, to find the eigenvalue.


-- The next lines of code explain how the ansatz is given in general. The ansatz has some depth p, and all parameters
-- the ansatz is depending on are given by two matrices of angles, represented by the RotationAnglesMatrix type.

------------- THE HAMILTONIAN -------------------------------------------------------

-- The ansatz gives us some vector |psi>, that depends on some parameters
-- We want to find the minimum value of <psi|H|psi> over all possible parameters
-- To do that, we need a way to compute <psi|H|psi>.

-- This is easy if H is an tensor product of Pauli Matrices. In this case, one can build a circuit U_H
-- such that, if we build the circuit U_H|psi> and measure the first qubit, then
-- <psi|H|psi> is equal to x - y where x (resp.y) is the probability of measuring 0 (resp. 1)


-- More generally, if H is a sum of tensor product of Pauli Matrices, say H = a_1 H_1 + ... a_k H_k
-- then one can obtain <psi|H|psi> by computing separately each <psi|H_i|psi> using the previous idea

-- As a consequence, for all intent and purposes here, we suppose that Hamiltonians are given by linear combinations of
-- tensor product of Pauli Matrices.
-- This is represented by the type Hamiltonian below, that is a list of pairs (coefficient, tensor product of pauli matrix)

-- Now the next lines of code  explain how to obtain the  value of <psi|H|psi>, first for a tensor product of Pauli matrices, then more generally.

-- First here is the definition of U_H, the unitary s.t. measuring U_H|psi> makes us able to compute <psi|H|psi>:

--------------------- COMPUTE THE ENERGY ------------------------------

-- The value of the energy <psi|H|psi> can be computed by applying a unitary operator U_H to |psi> and mesuring the first qubit
-- Here the operator U_H uses one more  qubits than H. It is possible to use the exact same number of qubits, but the code is easier this way.

-- the next function computes <psi|H|psi>, for H a tensor product of Pauli Matrices
-- This is the function that needs to run the quantum circuit
-- As explained above, to obtain <psi|H|psi>, we produce a circuit for U_H|psi> and then measure the first qubit
-- The value of <psi|H|psi> is then equal to the probability of measuring 0 minus the probability of measuring 1
-- the following code runs the whole experiment nSamples times,
-- and records the number of time we measure 0 and the number of times we measure 1 and returns the difference between the two quantities
-- if nSamples is big enough, then <psi|H|psi> is therefore well approximated by the result of this function divided by the number of samples.

--------------------- CLASSICAL OPTIMISATION ------------------------


--- The energy that is compute by the function computeEnergy is fed to the function classicalOptimisation before
--- That will produces  new parameters for the ansatz to try, based on the value of <psi|H|psi> on all previous runs


--- This function should use general optimisation techniques, like for instance the Nelder-Mead method
--- For simplicity, we opted instead for a function that returns random parameters

-----------------------PUTTING QUANTUM AND CLASSICAL PARTS TOGETHER -------------------------

-- the next value of |psi> to test

--- The VQE algorithm just calls the previous function, and returns the minimum value of <psi|H|psi> that was observed
--- Note that, in practice, if the classical Optimiser does their job correctly, the minimum value of <psi|H|psi>
--- is very likely to be obtained in the last iteration. As we use a random function instead of an optimiser, this is
--- not true, so we take the minimum among all runs.

# Qimaera
Idris libraries for hybrid classical-quantum programming.

## <a id="installing"></a> Installing Idris2

The current version of the library works for Idris2 0.6.0.

Previous versions of the library have been tested under Idris2 0.4.0 and 0.5.1.

The latest version of Idris can be found [here](https://www.idris-lang.org/pages/download.html), and all the instructions for installing it can be found [here](https://idris2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/starting.html).

## <a id="compiling"></a> Compiling Qimaera

Type `make package` to build the whole package.

Type `./run` to run the built-in example.

## <a id="getting_started"></a> Getting Started

We strongly recommend starting by reading the following paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10867. It describes some of the main design ideas and explains how some of our libraries and functions should be understood.

Next, we recommend reading and executing the code from file `Example.idr`. It contains simple examples using the functions defined in `Unitary.idr` and `QuantumOp.idr`.

## <a id="overview"></a> Library Overview

### **`Unitary.idr`**

An algebraic representation of unitary quantum circuits.

The `Unitary` data type represents unitary circuits.
The `Unitary` data type is parametrized by the arity of the corresponding unitary operator. It has 4 constructors : 

 * `IdGate` : parametrized by a natural number n, it represents a circuit with n wires, without any other gate applied to any of the wires.
 * `H`      : Hadamard gate, takes as argument the index of the wire on which it should be applied (for a circuit of size n, the indices go from 0 to n-1). The second argument, which is implicit (and can be often inferred by the compiler), is a proof obligation that this index is smaller than the size of the circuit.
 * `P`      : Phase gate, its first argument (a Double) being the associated phase. The other arguments serve the same purpose as H.
 * `CNOT`   : Controlled-NOT gate to the control (c argument) and the target (t argument) wires. Here, we add the constraint that the two wires have to be distinct.
 
As all quantum circuits can be represented as a composition or tensor product of Hadamard, Phase and CNOT gates, we only need these three constructors to build any circuit.


Higher level functions to build more complicated circuits are also defined in this file :

 * `compose`    : sequential composition of unitary circuits.
 * `tensor`     : parallel composition (tensor product) of unitary circuits.
 * `apply`      : apply some unitary circuit to another one.
 * `adjoint`    : the adjoint of a unitary circuit.
 * `controlled` : controlled version of a unitary circuit.

Some examples using these functions can be found in the `Examples.idr` file.

The most common gates (HGate, PGate, CNOTGate, TGate, SGate, ZGate, XGate, RxGate, RyGate, RzGate) are given as unitary gates of size 1 or 2.

Visualize circuits : 

 * `draw`           : Draw a circuit in the terminal.
 * `exportToQiskit` : Export a circuit to Qiskit code for a graphical rendering.

This file also provides some function to compute the number of gates and the depth of a circuit.


### **`QStateT.idr`**

Quantum state transformer for effectful quantum computation (used in the file `QuantumOp.idr`).

The type `QStateT initialType finalType returnType` means we are performing a quantum operation from an initial state with type initialType, to a final state with type finalType, and we return a user-accessible value of type returnType.

This was inspired by the indexed state monad in Haskell and we adapted it to also handle linearity, probabilistic effects and IO effects. 


### **`QuantumOp.idr`**

Defines the `Qubit` type, the `QuantumOp` interface for quantum operations and provides an implementation of this interface for simulations.

The Qubit type is used to identify individual qubits. This type does not carry any quantum state information.

The QuantumOp interface is an abstraction used to represent quantum operations. It introduces a few operations on qubits:

 * `newQubits`    : Adds p new qubits to a quantum state.
 * `applyUnitary` : Apply a unitary circuit to a selection of qubits. The parameters are the linear vector of qubit identifiers for the set of qubits and the unitary operator.
 * `measure`      : Measure a set of qubits.
 * `run`          : Execute a sequence of quantum operations.

We also provide a concrete implementation of this interface, called SimulatedOp, which provides linear-algebraic simulation of all the required quantum operations.

### **`Examples.idr`**

This file contains simple examples of programs (unitary circuits and quantum operations) to get started with the libraries.

### **`ExampleDetectableErrors.idr`**

This file contains common examples of inadmissible programs that can be detected by the Idris type checker.


### **`Lemmas.idr`**

Proofs of all the lemmas used to define all the basic function in `Unitary.idr`. Some of these lemmas are reused in quantum algorithms.

### **`LinearTypes.idr`**

Defines some linear types such as linear vectors, and implements some basic functions with these types.

### **`Matrix.idr`**

Defines all necesary matrix operations for the linear-algebraic simulation.

### **`QFT.idr`**

The quantum circuit for the Quantum Fourier Transform. Calling `qft n` returns the QFT on n qubits.

### **`Teleportation.idr`**

Implementation of the quantum teleportation protocol. 

### **`QAOA.idr`**

Implementation of QAOA with the vanilla optimisation procedure to solve the MAXCUT problem.
QAOA is an example of a variational quantum algorithm that is used to solve optimisation problems.
This code shows how classical and quantum programming interact with each other.


### **`Graph.idr`**

Definition of graphs used in `QAOA.idr` for solving the MAXCUT problem.

### **`VQE.idr`**

Implementation of the VQE algorithm with a vanilla classical optimisation strategy.
It is also a variational quantum algorithm.

### **`RUS.idr`**

Implementation of the Repeat Until Success algorithm.

This example illustrates the difference between computing unitary operators and doing effectful quantum operations: here we realise a quantum unitary operator by using measurements and recursion.

Given an input qubit |q> and a single-qubit unitary operation U, return the state U|q>. The "Repeat Until Success" approach solves this problem in the following way:

 1. Prepare a new qubit in state |0>.
 2. Apply a two-qubit unitary operator U' (chosen in advance depending on U).
 3. Measure the first qubit.
 4. If the measurement outcome is 0, then the output state is U |psi>, as required, and the algorithm terminates; otherwise the current state is E|psi>, where E is some other unitary operator (chosen in advance depending on U), so we apply $E^\dagger$ to
this state and we go back to step (1).

### **`CoinToss.idr`**

A quantum state transformer which realises a fair coin toss in the obvious way: 

 * first create a new qubit in state |0>
 * then apply a hadamard gate to it, thereby preparing state |+>
 * and finally measure the qubit and return this as the result


### **`OptimiseUnitary.idr`**

A simple function for basic optimisation of quantum circuits. The main purpose here is to show how unitary circuits in Qimaera can be manipulated to be optimised with respect to some criterion.

### **`Main.idr`**

More examples of the different algorithms we implemented.
Uncomment some lines to execute the corresponding programs.
